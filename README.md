# 📦 Hematology Patient Information Database (Web Application)

Team 8 has developed a web application designed to support health sciences students studying hematology. The application simulates real-world tools and systems that students will encounter in their future careers, providing them with practical experience. It enables users to store, manage, and query patient information related to hematological conditions. This hands-on approach helps students familiarize themselves with patient data management, querying techniques, and the essential tools used in the healthcare industry.
